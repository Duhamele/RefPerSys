# The primordial CLASS object is the "base" for all objects in Refpersys.
# This is very incomplete at the current stage. Abhishek is guessing that this
# primordial CLASS object would require closures for common functionality of all
# objects.

# Abhishek is guessing that the initdata.rps file needs to define the
# "primitive" or fundamental data types, such as bool, int, char in the C
# language. Abhishek is guessing that these fundamental types will all be class
# objects (e.g. as in Python, where every class is an object) that are "derived"
# from the primordial CLASS object _7yYCtEQKshP00noCyM (defined above).
# Accordingly, Abhishek is defining the primitive Boolean class object. Abhishek
# is requesting Dr. Basile to kindly review and suggest whether Abhishek is
# going in the right direction.
