# short term todo list for *RefPerSys* #

This file `SHORT-TERM-TODO.md` (using
[markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax) documents
technical small tasks related to [RefPerSys](http://refpersys.org/)

The intuition is to mention here a few things which should take less
than a few days of work.

## TODO List

For *RefPerSys* near commit `111e7d81a00fe` (jan. 2023)


Improve the REPL parsing so that `make test03` works

## DONE  List

The predefined root object `_4DsQEs8zZf901wT1LH` informally named
`the_mutable_set_of_classes` should have its naming symbol
`the_mutable_set_of_classes` and should be filled with all classes
objects. The routine `Rps_ObjectRef::make_named_class` should be
improved to fill `the_mutable_set_of_classes`
