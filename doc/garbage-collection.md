# RefPerSys garbage collection (GC)

[Garbage
collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science))
is a well understood topic, and has some well established
terminology. It is tightly related to [dynamic memory
allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management#ALLOCATION). RefPerSys
uses mostly [tracing garbage
collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection)
techniques. Efficient GC requires making several important trade-offs,
so is more an art than a science.


## GC concepts and terminology

For basic GC concepts and terminology, read first Paul Wilson's
[*Uniprocessor Garbage Collection
Techniques*](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~javaplt/311/Readings/wilson92uniprocessor.pdf)
survey [1992
IWMM](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0017182) paper. Then read [The GC handbook](http://gchandbook.org/) (ISBN: 978-1420082791) or at least its predecessor: Richard Jones' [Garbage Collection](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/rej/gcbook/) (ISBN: 0-471-94148-4) book.


A *mutator thread* (see
[this](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thierry_Le_Sergent/publication/221032842_Incremental_Multi-threaded_Garbage_Collection_on_Virtual_Shared_Memory_Architectures)
paper) is a RefPerSys Posix or C++ thread which uses the garbage
collector (either for *allocating* new quasi-values, or for *updating*
existing ones). 

## technical approach in practice

A RefPerSys garbage collected memory zone is an instance of some
subclass of `Rps_ZoneValue`, which conceptually is a [tagged
union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union), discriminated by
some `Rp_Type` enum. The pointer to such a GC-allocated zone is called
a *quasi-value* (so by extension, that memory zone is also called
*quasi-value*). Of course, first class RefPerSys values and objects
are also quasi-values (but genuine values can also be [*tagged
integers*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_pointer)).

Our GC is a *precise* garbage collector, so needs to
know and scan all the quasi-values on the [call
stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack). Because there is no
way to reliably get each call frame and all the quasi-values in them,
the calling frame is a required argument (conventionally named
`callingfra`) to every allocating or updating primitive that mutator
threads could call, and our call frames are actually reified as
instances of subclasses of `Rps_CallFrameZone`.

For immutable values and most mutable quasivalues - those which are
[POD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_data_structure) without
internal [C++ containers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container)
-, the RefPerSys GC is using a
[Cheney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheney%27s_algorithm)-like
[generational
GC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Generational_GC_(ephemeral_GC))
algorithm. But for objects -the only mutable values- some [tri-color
mark and
sweep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection)
approach is required.

The mutator threads are required to call more or less periodically
`Rps_GarbageCollector::maybe_garbcoll`, or, usually indirectly, the
write barrier macro `RPS_WRITE_BARRIER`, or, often indirectly, one of
the `allocate_rps_zone` allocation functions. It is expected that
these functions are called at least once every several milliseconds in
each mutator threads (in practice, not a big deal, since allocations
or updates of values or objects happens much more often). These
mutator threads are started specially : we should define some
`Rps_MutatorThread` class, subclass of
[`std::thread`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/thread)
constructed without argument (so a thread object which is not yet a
genuine Pthread). Special precautions
(i.e. `Rps_MutatorThread::disable_garbage_collector` then
`Rps_MutatorThread::enable_garbage_collector` or
`Rps_MutatorThread::do_without_garbage_collector`) need to be taken,
in mutator threads, for the few operating system *blocking operations*
(e.g. mutex locking and thread synchronization operations, or
[poll(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html), blocking
[recv(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/recv.2.html) or
[read(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html) from a
*non-seekable* file such as a
[socket(7)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html) or a
[pipe(7)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pipe.7.html) or a
[pty(7)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pty.7.html), maybe
blocking [send(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/send.2.html)
or [write(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html) to a
*non-seekable* file (also most [device
files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file#Character_devices)). In
practice, we want to have some [event
loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop) threads, and
`libonion`-created threads for HTTP service.

When any thread (including the main thread) is not *explicitly*
started as some mutator thread (since it is not a subclass of
``Rps_MutatorThread`) is allocating or updating quasi-values, that
operation is still possible but runs slower, using some single global
mutex, Ã  la
[GIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock).


## threads in the loader

Since the loader is practically reading *plain* files sitting in the
[page cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache), the underlying
[read(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html) is never
blocking, since the plain file is seekable (e.g. with [fseek(3)](
https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fseek), etc... or just
[lseek(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html)...). The
loader code would of course use
[rewind(3)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/rewind.3.html)
between first and second passes, since it uses `<stdio.h>`.

So a multi-threaded loader would use `Rps_MutatorThread` to create its
threads.
