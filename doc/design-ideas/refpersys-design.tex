    \textit{\textsc{RefPerSys}} is a \textsc{\textbf{Ref}}lexive and
    orthogonally \textsc{\textbf{Per}}sistent \textsc{\textbf{Sys}}tem
    (as a GPLv3+ licensed free software\footnote{Some code is
    available on
    \href{https://gitlab.com/bstarynk/refpersys}{\texttt{gitlab.com/bstarynk/refpersys}}.})
    running on Linux; it is a hobby but serious \textbf{research
      project} for many years, mostly aimed to experiment \textbf{open
      science} ideas close to
    {AGI}\footnote{{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\_general\_intelligence}{Artificial
        General Intelligence}}} dreams, and we don't expect useful or
    interesting results before several years of hard work.
  \end{abstract}

  \textbf{audience :} \textsc{Linux} free software
  developers\footnote{Those \textsc{Linux} software developers are
  routinely \emph{glancing inside}, \emph{building} then using -from
  their published source code- quite large open source programs (such
  as \href{http://gcc.gnu.org/}{\textsc{Gcc}},
  \href{http://sbcl.org/}{\textsc{Sbcl}},
  \href{https://www.call-cc.org/}{\textsc{Chicken-Scheme}},

  \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/}{\textsc{Emacs}},
  \href{https://sqlite.org/}{\textsc{Sqlite}},
  \href{https://mariadb.org/}{\textsc{MariaDb}}, etc...)  and perhaps
  even contributing to smaller free software projects like
  \href{https://ninja-build.org/}{\textsc{Ninja}},
  \href{https://github.com/davidmoreno/onion}{\texttt{libonion}},
  etc... By the way, all these open source projects could be useful to
  or inspirational for \RefPerSys.} and computer scientists interested in
  an experimental open science approach to reflexive systems,
  orthogonal persistence, symbolic artificial intelligence, knowledge
  engines, etc....

  \textbf{Nota Bene:} this report contains
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink}{hyperlinks} so its
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF}{PDF} should rather be read
  on a computer screen, e.g. with
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evince}{\texttt{evince}}. Since
  it describes a circular design (with many
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph}{cycles}
  \cite{Hofstadter:1979:GEB}), we recommend to read it twice (skipping
  footnotes and references on the first read).

\section{\textsc{RefPerSys} ambitions and goals}
\label{sec:ambitions-goals}


\subsection{\textsc{RefPerSys} core idea{\texttt{[\textit{l}]\textsuperscript{?}}}s}
\label{subsec:coreidea}

The title of this subsection is \emph{not} a typo\footnote{It is a
geeky pun on words with
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell}{shell}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)}{globbing} and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular\_expression}{regexpr} like
syntax.}. We indeed mean both \textit{ideas} (that is, software design
and architectural concepts, guiding our daily implementation efforts)
and \textit{ideals} (that is, long term research objectives and
ambitions).

The \RefPerSys\footnote{For a \textbf{Ref}lexive \textbf{Per}sistent
  \textbf{Sys}tem}~ system shares several -but not all- goals and
design ideas (but no code) with
\href{http://github.com/bstarynk/bismon}{\texttt{bismon}}
\cite{Starynkevitch:2019:bismon-draft} but of course \emph{not}
\texttt{bismon}'s application\footnote{I Basile am not allowed and not
  funded to directly work on
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence}{AGI}
  -which still is my major personal scientific interest- but I do get
  funded on applied research projects like
  \href{https://www.decoder-project.eu/}{\textsc{Decoder}} and try to
  push some AGI ideas into them.} to
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis}{static
  source code analysis}. Like \texttt{bismon}, {\RefPerSys} is a
\textbf{reflexive} (it uses
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)}{reflection}),
\textbf{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual\_machine\_introspection}{introspective}}
and \textbf{orthogonally
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)}{persistent}}
system, but not for
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis}{static
  program analysis}. Please read Bismon's draft report
\cite{Starynkevitch:2019:bismon-draft} for a more precise definition
of these concepts. \textbf{\RefPerSys~ is a long term\footnote{I don't
    expect any significant AGI research results before $\approx
    2026$.}  risky
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research}{research} project with
  an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science}{open science}
  mindset and
  \href{https://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/introduction/}{reproducible
    experiment} ethics \cite{zuboff:2015:big-other,
    oneil:2016:weapons}, and a
  \href{https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html}{free software}
  licensed under
  \href{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html}{GPLv3+}, and
  targetted \emph{only} for \textsc{Linux x86-64} computers.}. A Linux
system\footnote{My own \texttt{ours.starynkevitch.net} computer,
  running \textit{Debian/Unstable}, has 64 Gibytes of RAM, 24 cores
  (AMD 2970WX) and terabytes of disk space, including a terabyte of
  SSD.}  with at least 16 Gibytes of RAM, 4 \textit{x86-64} cores, and
220 Gibytes of disk is required. The grand ambition of {\RefPerSys} is
to become later an infrastructure for some strong
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence}{AGI}
system Ã  la \textsc{Caia}\footnote{With explicit permission from
  J.Pitrat, \textsc{Caia} source code -entirely generated by itself,
  about half a million lines of C code- is available on
  \href{http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/}{my (Basile's) web page} as
  \href{http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/caia-su-24feb2016.tar.bz2}{\texttt{caia-su-24feb2016.tar.bz2}},
  and you could build it with \texttt{gcc -O -g [A-Z]*.c -rdynamic
    -ldl} then run \texttt{./a.out}. However, since I Basile sadly
  failed to convince J.Pitrat that open source
  \cite{Lerner-Tirole:2000:economics-open-source,
    Weber:2004:SuccessOpenSource} software are -in our
  XXI\textsuperscript{th} century- also an important way to transmit
  research ideas, there are no complete instructions to use it. Hence
  \textsc{Caia} has an undocumented user interface as user-friendly as
  the one of \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/}{\texttt{ed}} but
  convenient enough to J.Pitrat alone! If you are capable of reading
  some comments in French and guessing the semantics of declarative
  ``expert system'' like rules (\textsc{Caia} has more than a dozen of
  thousands of them), run it, then type \texttt{L EDITE} and start
  reverse-engineering that brillant \textsc{Caia} system.}  by Jacques
Pitrat\footnote{Jacques Pitrat has passed away on October
  14\textsuperscript{th}, 2019. See quickly also his old web page on
  \href{http://jacques.pitrat.pagesperso-orange.fr/}{\texttt{jacques.pitrat.pagesperso-orange.fr}}
  and his interesting blog on
  \href{http://bootstrappingartificialintelligence.fr/WordPress3/}{\texttt{bootstrappingartificialintelligence.fr/WordPress3}}
  \ldots} \cite{Pitrat:1996:FGCS, Pitrat:2009:AST,
  Pitrat:2009:ArtifBeings}, but before even approaching that goal a
big lot of work is required, and {\RefPerSys} should be valuable by
itself for other less ambitious and more pragmatical purposes, perhaps
some specialized collaborative web server (GPLv3+) to ease
communication between human {\RefPerSys} developers, that is a mix of
a wiki, a chat, and a tool for sharing document with drawings or
graphics.

The development of {\RefPerSys} is (like the one of \texttt{bismon},
or
\href{http://bootstrappingartificialintelligence.fr/WordPress3/?s=CAIA}{of
  \textsc{Caia}}) a slow, incremental and gradual
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping}{bootstrapping}
process with a meta-programming \cite{dormoy:1992:meta} approach :
features added to {\RefPerSys} in January 2020 are used to implement
new features worked on a later {\RefPerSys} in March 2020.

As every practical software, {\RefPerSys} targets some defined
machines: common Linux distribution running on some
computer\footnote{For several years, that computer is a desktop or
powerful laptop running some \textsc{Debian}. Later that could be some
``virtual machine'' e.g. some
\href{https://www.docker.com/}{\textsc{Docker}} container.}. So the
target machine of {\RefPerSys} is a quite complete and modern Linux
system (such as a recent \textit{\textsc{Debian}} or
\textit{\textsc{Ubuntu}} desktop), with many useful packages, and
administred by some human person\footnote{For obvious cybersecurity
reasons, automatic administration of that Linux distribution is out of
scope. Also, since Basile Starynkevitch is still working (in october
2019) in a cybersecurity
\href{http://www-list.cea.fr/en/technological-research/research-programmes/embedded-systems/validation-and-verification}{lab}
(of about 25 permanent staff) at
\href{http://www-list.cea.fr/}{CEA/LIST}, cybersecurity concerns would
be a conflict of interest.}. The {\RefPerSys} system is published in
``source'' form, as a set of \href{http://git-scm.com/}{\texttt{git}}
versioned\footnote{We crucially depend upon \texttt{git}
\emph{specifically} (e.g. \href{http://gitlab.org/}{\texttt{gitlab}}),
and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting}{porting} {\RefPerSys}
to some other versioning system -or to some other
\href{http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/}{operating system} than
\textsc{Linux}- would be a quite difficult task.} textual files
(e.g. \textit{C++} or \textit{C} files\footnote{However, notice that
bootstrapped language implementations like
\href{http://s48.org/}{Scheme 48} or \href{https://ocaml.org/}{Ocaml}
are keeping some
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode}{bytecode} form under
version control, and \href{https://www.call-cc.org/}{\textsc{Chicken
    Scheme}} is, like \texttt{bismon}, \texttt{git}-keeping generated
C files.}, perhaps some
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile}{\texttt{Makefile}} or
better yet an
\href{http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/omake.html}{\textsc{Omake}}
build -most and more and more\footnote{Of course, in a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg}{chicken and
  egg} fashion, the initial version of {\RefPerSys} has to contain
mostly hand-written files!} of them being generated- or shell files or
data files). Some of these files are generated, and the bootstrapping
goal is to have \emph{every} \texttt{git}-registered textual file been
generated by {\RefPerSys}, with a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping\_(compilers)}{\textbf{bootstrap}ed}
approach\footnote{Observe that Linux source distributions like \href{http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/}{\texttt{linuxfromscratch.org}}, or to a lesser extent \href{https://www.gentoo.org/}{GenToo}, are also, when considered as a single system, fully bootstrapped.} similar to those of
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)}{self-hosting
  compilers}.
\medskip

Within {\RefPerSys}, we call\footnote{Notice that, on purpose, our
terminology is different of usual habits in the open source realm:
almost all software projects (see also
\href{http://softwareheritage.org}{\texttt{softwareheritage.org}}) are
made of
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_file}{\textit{computer
    files}} typed by human developers in some
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code\_editor}{source-code
  editor} or some
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated\_development\_environment}{IDE}
such as \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/}{\texttt{emacs}},
\href{http://vim.org/}{\texttt{vim}} or
\href{http://codeblocks.org/}{\texttt{Code::Blocks}}, according to the
old \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix\_philosophy}{Unix
  philosophy}. Notice that large open source projects like the
\href{https://www.libreoffice.org/}{\textsc{LibreOffice}} suite, the
\href{http://gcc.gnu.org}{\textsc{Gcc}} compiler collection or the
\href{https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/}{FireFox} browser tend to
accept
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)}{plugins}
instead of favoring old fashioned
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)}{command
  pipelines}, but multi-threaded applications may follow the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software)}{pipeline
  design pattern}. In contrast, we are impatient to reach the state
where all {\RefPerSys} source files have been \texttt{git}-versioned
but are all generated by a previous run of our \texttt{refpersys}
executable. The {\RefPerSys} developer is interacting, thru a web
interface, with some running \texttt{refpersys} process, which is also some
specialized web server (using  HTTP).}  ``source file'' any Linux file which is
\texttt{git}-versioned. We hope that more and more of these source
files will be generated by the \texttt{refpersys}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable\_and\_Linkable_Format}{ELF}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable}{executable}
program. \textbf{A significant milestone is the entire bootstrapping
  of \RefPerSys}, when all files (in textual form, to stay
\texttt{git}-friendly, like
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_protocol}{text based
  protocols} are more friendly for developers) can be regenerated by
the \texttt{refpersys} executable, exactly in the same state as they
were previously\footnote{Pedantically, some
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed\_point\_(mathematics)}{fixpoint}
of some very coarse-grained
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational\_semantics}{operational
  semantics} related to
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract\_interpretation}{abstract
  interpretation} and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational\_semantics\#Structural\_operational\_semantics}{big
  step semantics}, each big step being the entire regeneration of the
system, inspired by Futurama projections and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial\_evaluation}{partial
  evaluation}.} : as a whole, our {\RefPerSys} system should become a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine\_(computing)}{Quine
  program}, and \textsc{Caia} is already one. So the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build\_automation}{build
  automation} tool which compiles {\RefPerSys} should use file
contents, not modification times to trigger compilation commands,
since a full regeneration of such a bootstrapped {\RefPerSys} system
will touch all files, without changing the content of any of
them. Hence and very concretely, for building {\RefPerSys} the
\href{http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/omake.html}{\texttt{omake}}
build automation tool is preferable to \textsc{Gnu}
\href{https://www.gnu.org/software/make/}{\texttt{make}}.

For pragmatical reasons, \textbf{{\RefPerSys} needs a good
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing\_garbage\_collection}{garbage
    collector}} (or GC \cite{jones:2016:gchandbook}), since fully
compile-time GC \cite{mazur:2004:compile} are too difficult to
implement. Since multi-core x86-64 machines are very common, it should
take advantage of them, so \textbf{{\RefPerSys} should follow a
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)}{multi-threaded}
  approach} above \textsc{Posix} \cite{barney:2010:pthreads} or
\href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread}{C++11 threads}. Our GC
should be a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Precise_vs._conservative_and_internal_pointers}{precise}
garbage collector \cite{Rafkind:2009:PreciseGC} and we may want to
favor, like what was done in \textsc{Gcc Melt}
\cite{Starynkevitch:2007:Multistage, Starynkevitch-DSL2011,
  Starynkevitch-GCCMELTweb}, fast allocation of small memory zones
which get quickly disposed of when becoming dead using a copying
generational
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheney's\_algorithm}{Cheney-like
  GC algorithm} \cite{wilson:1992:uniprocessorgc}.  But mixing
precise, sometimes generational GC techniques with multi-threading is
a difficult programming task. But precise-GC friendly programming is
simpler in generated C or C++ code that with hand-written code
(because of explicit management of local GC roots and write barriers,
Ã  la
\href{http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/qishintro.html}{\textsc{Qish}}
or
\href{https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html}{\textsc{Ocaml}}:
garbage collection invariants are boring and brittle to maintain in
hand-written code).


\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(computer_science)}{Reification}
is an important concept in \RefPerSys, including (later) at the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning}{knowledge
  representation} level with
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network}{semantic
  networks} and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(artificial_intelligence)}{frames}. {\RefPerSys}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack}{call stacks} are made
of call frames known to our garbage collector (like
\href{https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html}{\textsc{Ocaml}}'s
ones). They could later be copied into data structures representing
some
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimited_continuation}{delimited
  continuations} \cite{Reynolds:1993:continuations,
  Queinnec:2004:ContinWeb}, perhaps even representing and describing
control \cite{fouet-starynkevitch:describing-control:1987,
  Starynkevitch-1990-EUM, Pitrat:2009:ArtifBeings}. This should also
enable \textbf{introspection}, by permitting primitives inspecting the
current call stack, perhaps using Ian Taylor's
\href{https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/libbacktrace}{\texttt{libbacktrace}}.


{\RefPerSys} should (like \textsc{Caia} and its predecessor
\textsc{Malice} did
\cite{Pitrat:2009:AST,Pitrat:1996:FGCS,Pitrat:2009:ArtifBeings}) have
some expert system shell \cite{kumar:2015:importance-expert-systems,
  nigro:2008:meta} and meta-rules to ``dynamically compile'' some
subset of expert system rules and knowledge bases to procedural code
(e.g. with a metaprogramming approach of generating \emph{C} code, or
\href{https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/}{\texttt{libgccjit}}
compiled code, then
\href{http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlopen.3.html}{\texttt{dlopen(3)}}-ing
that code and running it at runtime. The
\href{https://github.com/bstarynk/misc-basile/blob/master/manydl.c}{\texttt{manydl.c}}
program show that this can practically be done many dozen of thousands
of times on Linux desktops).

{\RefPerSys} will extensively use
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming}{\textbf{metaprogramming}}
techniques, so it \textbf{should generate code} (like \textsc{Caia}
do) in a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler}{transpiler}
approach (in C, C++, -compiled into
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in\_(computing)}{plugins} and
later
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic\_loading}{dynamically
  loaded} with \href{}{\texttt{dlopen(3)}}- maybe also JavaScript and
HTML5 if we decide to have a web user interface). {\RefPerSys} could
also later use
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation}{just-in-time
  compilation} libraries such as
\href{https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/}{\texttt{libgccjit}}. The
domain-specific language of \RefPerSys\footnote{That domain-specific
language has to be defined and implemented in a bootstrapped manner.}
(a declarative one, with ``expert system rules'') should gradually
increase its expressiveness and become more and more declarative and
closer to mathematical formalisms.

Most Linux distributions contain lots of useful libraries or software
components for {\RefPerSys} long-term goals, notably machine learning
open source libraries like
\href{https://www.tensorflow.org/}{\textsc{TensorFlow}}
\cite{charniak:2019:deep-learning} or
\href{https://gudhi.inria.fr/}{\textsc{Gudhi}}
\cite{chazal:2016:high}. We might at some point also need messaging
libraries like \href{https://zeromq.org/}{\textsc{0mq}}, graphical
user interfaces libraries Ã  la \href{http://qt.io/}{\textsc{Qt}} or
more probably web servicing libraries like
\href{https://github.com/davidmoreno/onion/}{\texttt{libonion}} or
\href{https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt}{\textsc{Wt}}. To decrease efforts,
we don't want to rewrite such libraries inside {\RefPerSys} (considered
as a very high level,
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative\_programming}{declarative},
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific\_language}{domain-specific
  language}). Hence, we will need in {\RefPerSys} to generate some
glue code, like \href{http://swig.org/}{\textsc{Swig}} does, from some
\textbf{declarative description} (probably some frames or knowledge
bases) of the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface}{API}
of these available libraries.

{\RefPerSys} should at first be \textbf{orthogonally
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence\_(computer\_science)}{persistent}}. Like
\textsc{Bismon} \cite{Starynkevitch:2019:bismon-draft} it will load
its state (its entire garbage-collected
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory\_management#HEAP}{heap})
from files at startup, and will dump its state\footnote{In a manner
inspired by \textsc{Sbcl}
\href{http://www.sbcl.org/manual/index.html\#Saving-a-Core-Image}{\texttt{save-lisp-and-die}}
primitive, or \href{https://www.polyml.org/}{\textsc{PolyML}}
\href{https://www.polyml.org/documentation/Reference/PolyMLStructure.html\#export}{\texttt{export}}

textual\footnote{We should decide if we use some
\href{http://json.org/}{\textsc{Json}} or
\href{http://yaml.org/}{\textsc{Yaml}} notation, or our own one for
\RefPerSys.} and \texttt{git}-versioned, and should be portable to
other 64 bits Linux computers. A

describing the collection of files keeping the state is probably
needed.

\subsection{{\RefPerSys} strange development cycle}
\label{subsec:strange-devel}

Ordinary software projects tend to follow a spiral development model
\cite{boehm:1988:spiral} as shown in figure \ref{fig:tradspiral}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{spiral-model-softdevel}

  \caption{the \textbf{traditional spiral development} model (from Wikipedia \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model}{spiral model})}
  \label{fig:tradspiral}
\end{figure}
%
But \RefPerSys' development follows a strange loop
\cite{hofstadter:2007:strange-loop}, since it is bootstrapped in an
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software\_prototyping\#Evolutionary\_prototyping}{evolutionary
  prototyping} manner. It is more like a spiral staircase like in
figure \ref{fig:bootstrap-stair}. The initial (floor) is just a
persistent system, and we gradually add new code implementing more
features (first entirely hand-written, later more and more parts of it
replaced by {\RefPerSys} generated code). Of course the fun is in
replacing existing hand-written code (or low-level DSL) by more
expressive and generated one. So we will continuously rewrite past
formalizations as a more clever and expressive ones, taking more and
more advantage of {\RefPerSys} whole-system introspective abilities.

its integers -even for arithmetic used inside its compiler- as

\cite{chambers:1991:efficient} (or even

systems and their incremental development process are inspirational.

\subsection{\textsc{RefPerSys} persistent heap}
\label{subsec:persistheap}

When {\RefPerSys} is running in some multi-threaded \textsc{Linux}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process\_(computing)}{process}, the
     {\RefPerSys} persistent heap is (like Bismon's one
     \cite{Starynkevitch:2019:bismon-draft}) semantically like the
     memory heap of most
     \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic\_programming\_language}{dynamic
       programming languages} (such as
     \href{https://python.org/}{\textsc{Python}},
     \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/}{\textsc{Guile}},
     \href{https://golang.org/}{\textsc{Go}},
     \href{http://sbcl.org/}{\textsc{Sbcl}}, etc \ldots). The
     \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\relsize{+1}{still incomplete}}} figure
     \ref{fig:persistent-heap} should give an intuition about that
     heap, when it is inside the
     \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_address_space}{virtual
       address space} of some \texttt{refpersys} process. We strongly
     want to avoid any
     \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global\_interpreter\_lock}{GIL},
     but multi-threaded precise efficient garbage collector
     implementations are quite difficult to code. However, notice that
     the persistence (on disk files) of a heap uses algorithms similar
     to those of copying garbage collectors
     \cite{wilson:1992:uniprocessorgc, jones:2016:gchandbook}.
